# Amazon.co.uk WebDriver highlight example

This very brief example demonstrates how to highlight elements in the browser when performing WebDriver commands.

The accompanying blog post can be found [here](http://bensnape.com/2012/03/31/highlighting-elements-in-selenium-webdriver/).

## Running the example

Please ensure that you have <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> installed.

Do the following in the same directory as the pom.xml file:

	mvn install

You should see Firefox performing the brief test and WebDriver highlighting the elements it is interacting with.
